            <h2>The Boston Massacre in 3D: Mapping, Modeling and Serious Gaming</h2>
            <br /> <p>
                <a href="https://serenazabin.com/game/">Witness to the Revolution</a>
                is an educational computer game built in
                <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>
                designed to teach the public about the events of the Boston Massacre. The game is a collaboration
                between Professor Austin Mason and Professor Serena Zabin at Carleton College, and
                will be installed at the Old State House in Boston upon completion as an introduction
                to the museum. Players of the game must piece together testimonies of the Boston Massacre
                in preparation for the soldiers’ trial as they decide whether to support the prosection or the defense.
                <br />
                <br />
                In Fall 2019, I enrolled in a course at Carleton College called
                <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/registrar/catalog/current/course-details/?subject=HIST&number=210">The Boston Massacre in 3D: Mapping, Modeling and Serious Gaming</a>
                where students helped build the digital infrastructure for the game. I worked on creating the user interface
                of the player’s map that he or she would use to navigate the streets of Boston. This involved designing the
                appearance of the map, including the typography, icons, and display, as well as implementing the design in Unity.
            </p>

            <br /><h2>Goal</h2>
            <br /><p class="goal">Create an interactive and functional map that the player can use to navigate the city of Boston</p>

            <br /><h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                <br />At the beginning of the project, the player's map consisted of a static image. The player could not
                zoom or pan and there were no recognizable features to help the player orient themselves.
                <br />
               <img class="project_page_image" src="images/initial_map.png" alt="The initial player map for Witness to the Revolution">
                <br />
                We began the process of creating the map by conducting a competitive analysis of maps from other video games.
                This increased our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different styles of player maps and
                helped us determine which design would work best for our needs. Then, we created a medium-fidelity
                prototype of the map in Photoshop to identify potential icons and fonts.
                <br />
                <br /> Using our prototype as a blueprint, we then transferred this vision to Unity where we added functionality
                and interactions. I wrote scripts in C# to animate icons, add pan/zoom, allow the user to toggle features on and off,
                and connect the map to other Unity scenes.
            </p>

            <br /><h2>Outcome</h2>

            <br /><p>
                By the conclusion of the project, we had an interactive prototype of the map that players
                could use. You can read my reflection on this work
