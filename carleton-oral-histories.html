            <br /><h2>Outcome</h2>


            <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/carleton/courses/HIST/200/">Historians for Hire</a> is a public history course at Carleton College that connects undergraduate students with community partners in Northfield, Minnesota to complete a historical research project.
            Students engage in discussions surrounding museums and history education throughout the course while also gaining hands-on experience in archival research, exhibit building, collaboration, and
            community service. I took this course in Winter 2020 and again in Spring 2021, focusing on two different projects.
            <br /> Carleton College is a private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota with an enrollment of
            approximately 2,100 students. The college has been operating since 1866 and is currently ranked
            by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the top ten liberal arts colleges in the United States. The mission
            of Carleton College is to provide an exceptional undergraduate liberal arts education.
            <br />
            In Winter 2021, I worked with a local historian, Sarah Entenmann, to conduct oral history interviews of African-American alumni from the 1970s. The purpose of the project was to document the experiences
            and feelings of Carleton’s earliest cohort of Black students, particularly those that received scholarships through the Rockefeller Grant. In doing so, we sought to restore Black voices to the archives,
            assess Carleton’s degree of success in supporting Black students, and identify areas of improvement for the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            This first project involved a large degree of archival research. I sifted through records of Carleton’s official school newspaper, The Carletonian, to find stories relating to the Rockefeller Grant and the
            Black experience at Carleton during the 70s. I also visited the Carleton College archives where I read through hundreds of documents related to the Rockefeller Grant and Carleton’s initiative to recruit students
            of color during the 60s and 70s. Following my research, I completed an <a href="https://archivedb.carleton.edu/index.php?p=digitallibrary/digitalcontent&id=87823&q=clifford">oral history interview with Clifford Clark</a>,
            a professor at Carleton who helped many of the Rockefeller Grant recipients.
