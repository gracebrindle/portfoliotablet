            <div class="bio">
                <p>
                    I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing a Master of Science in Information with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.
                    I graduated from Carleton College in  2021 with a major in History and a minor in Digital Arts &amp; Humanities. I
                    am passionate about creating people-first technology that is accessible, inclusive, and empathetic.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Digital Humanities</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As a History major, one of the primary things I learned is that stories have power:
                    how a story is told, what parts are emphasized, and for whom it is intended shape the communities around us.
                    I believe that technology is a potent storytelling device: data visualizations craft narratives,
                    websites host our stories, and creative programs like Photoshop bring our artistic visions to life. As a digital humanist,
                    I aspire to tell stories through technology that amplify marginalized voices,
                    connect communities, and bridge gaps between people, technology, and information.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Public Engagement and Community Service</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    When I was 18 years old, I convinced my mother to run for mayor of my hometown and dedicated my senior
                    year to working on her campaign. This experience instilled in me a passion for community engagement, service, and a
                    commitment to the social good that I have carried over to my professional career. I believe that technology
                    is a powerful tool for social change and should be used to create a kinder, more compassionate world. To that
                    end, I have worked with a number of community partners, including historical societies,
                    local artists, and non-profits, to advocate for these values and support their work.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>User Experience Research and Design</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Every product tells a story. I aim to craft a narrative that is centered around the user and their experience, one that is relatable to and enjoyed by all kinds of people.
                    Through this digital storytelling, I hope to invite joy, curiosity, and social connection—-to restore humanity to technology.
