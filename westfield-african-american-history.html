            <h2>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Association of Westfield</h2>
            <br /> <p>
                The <a href="https://www.mlkwestfield.org/">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Association</a> is a non-profit organization
                founded in Westfield, New Jersey in 1987. The mission of the organization is  to keep the memory of Dr. King alive by
                focusing the community on the important tenets from the words and life of Dr. King. The group advocates for
                the principles of justice, fairness, brotherhood, and non-violent community action espoused by Dr. King.

            </p>

            <br /> <p>
                I worked with the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Association and the Westfield Historical Society to produce a public history of the African-American community in
                Westfield. The African-American community has historically been underepresented in Westfield's history and this project sought to restore
                African-American residents and their contributions to the historical narrative. I created an internshp program for high school students
                and worked in a team to conduct research and create a virtual exhibit. The final outcome of this project was a walking tour, a brochure,
                and an interactive timeline.
            </p>

            <br /><h2>Goal</h2>
            <br /><p class="goal">Educate Westfield residents on local African-American history and restore
            the African-American community to the broader historical narrative</p>

            <br /><h2>Process</h2>
            <br /><p>
                The majority of our research relied on a database of digitized news articles from the Westfield Leader, the town's local newspaper. I recruited and
                worked with six high school interns to sort through the database and find any articles pertaining to the African-American community. Unfortunately,
                very little official documentation of the African-American community exists in Westfield so this project relied on subaltern methodologies
                such as reading against the grain to gather evidence and draw conclusions.
                <br />
                <br /> I created a spreadsheet to track the articles we found and met with the interns on a weekly basis over Zoom to discuss our findings. Over
                the course of the summer, we collected over 150 articles from 1910 to 2000 that spoke to the African-American community.
                <br />
                <br /><img src="images/Westfield_leader_spreadsheet.png" alt="A screenshot of the Excel sheet containing the list of newspaper articles">
                <br />
                <br /> Once this research was complete, I consulted with the MLK Association and the Westfield Historical Society to determine what they needed. Since this
                was in the midst of a pandemic, it was vital that the project existed in a digital format and was accessible to everyone. We decided to create a walking tour
                in Clio, a website dedicated to documenting historic sites, and supplement this walking tour with an interactive timeline.
                <br />
                <br /> I worked with my students to select the most important articles and findings from our research to insert into an interactive timeline.
                We created 38 events for our timeline with images and descriptions.
            </p>
            <br /><h2>Outcome</h2>
            <br /> The outcome of our project was a walking tour, an interactive timeline, and a brochure with a history of the African-American
            experience in Westfield. You can find the walking tour here and view the timeline below.
