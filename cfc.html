            <p>
                Client: Westfield Arts Collective
                <br /> Need: To build a website for their new art center, the Center for Creativity at the Rialto Theater
                <br /> Timeline: One week
                <br />
                <br /> For this project, I worked with a local art collective to create a website for their new community space. I began by meeting with the organization to understand
                their mission and needs. As a new organization, the Westfield Arts Collective was still in the process of developing their plan for the space and wanted a high degree
                of flexibility for the website. Their primary needs for the website were to inform community members and increase awareness, collect donations, and gather volunteer
                information.
                <br />
                <br /> After consulting with the organization, we decided that Wix would be the best platform for building the website. I began this process by outlining the pages and
                information architecture of the website. Once I established a structure that met the user's needs, I began to flesh out the content of the website. I chose a color scheme that
                matched the colors of the organization's logo and picked a minimalist sans-serif font for accessibility. I then added textual content and images using the organization's
                business plans and branding documents as a model.
                <br />
                <br /> Once these basic elements of the site were created, I focused on increasing the functionality of the site. I created a form to capture data from users who were
                interested in volunteering and integrated a PayPal donation form for those who wished to donate. I also optimized the website for search engines and accessibility,
                ensuring there was alternative text and sufficient color contrast on every page.
                <br />
